## ðŸ“Œ About

AEGIS is an intrusion detection & alerting system using eBPF for securing IoT devices. By introducing a new IoT device into the network, it acts ass a central hub for monitoring the remaining IoT devices (nodes) in the network.

## Motivation

A [study](https://www.fastly.com/blog/iot-industrys-response-emerging-threats) by Fastly states that, on average, once an IoT device is infected, it can begin launching an attack within 6 minutes of being exposed to the internet. Hence, network observability of devices is of utmost importance to detect intrusion in IoT networks.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

- Gain insights into network observability statistics of devices in an IoT network.

- Obtain alerts for any malicious activity flagged by the rule engine.

- Deploy the system by simply installing a binary on an IoT device in a network.

- Current system includes rules to flag malicious IPs, DoS, and ICMP flooding attacks.

## âš¡ Technologies Used

- eBPF: A technology that can run sandboxed programs in aÂ privileged contexts such as the operating system kernel.

- Rust: A systems programming language that enforces memory safety and helps interface with eBPF programs.

- Raspberry Pi: It is a low-cost micro-computer that can be easily deployed in an IoT network.

- Flask: A micro-web framework for creating server side applications using Python.
